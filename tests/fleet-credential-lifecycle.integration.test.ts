/**
 * Credential lifecycle, measured against a real running proxy rather than a registry object.
 *
 * The four claims this change makes are all claims about a SYSTEM, not about a function:
 *
 *   1. An issued credential binds at the credential tier.
 *   2. During a rotation both secrets work; after the window the old one is refused, and the
 *      refusal is in the audit chain.
 *   3. A revoked credential is refused while its siblings keep working.
 *   4. With the fleet minimum tier at "credential", an agent matching only comm is refused
 *      and the record says why.
 *
 * Every one of those depends on the CLI writing a file, a separate long-running process
 * noticing, /proc attribution, the registry, the enforcement gates, the proxy, and the chain
 * writer all agreeing. A unit test over AgentRegistry would exercise one of those seven and
 * would have passed just as happily if the running proxy never re-read the store, which is
 * the single most likely way for this feature to be green and useless.
 *
 * So: the credentials are minted by running `src/cli.ts` as its own process, the server is
 * started as its own process from a config file, requests come from child processes with
 * chosen comms, and the assertions read the audit JSONL the server wrote.
 *
 * Wall-clock waits are real and deliberate. Rotation expiry is a clock fact and the store's
 * staleness bound is a clock fact; fake timers in this process cannot move either, because
 * both live in a different process.
 *
 * Linux-only, because /proc attribution is. Skipped elsewhere rather than asserting less.
