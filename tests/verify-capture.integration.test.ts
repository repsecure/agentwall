/**
 * verify-capture, measured against a real proxy carrying real traffic.
 *
 * This file is the point of the feature. The assertion logic is unit tested next door, and a
 * unit test cannot see the failure this command exists to catch: three controls in this
 * repository shipped green and non-functional because their checks never touched the thing they
 * claimed to check. So every case below runs a genuine child process against a genuine
 * AgentWall on loopback and reads the chain that process actually wrote.
 *
 * The four acceptance cases, each constructed deliberately rather than simulated:
 *
 *   - a correctly configured agent passes, and the reported tier matches its match rule;
 *   - an agent that bypasses the proxy FAILS, built by running the fetch with the proxy
 *     variables unset;
 *   - an agent bound only by comm passes and is reported as weakly bound;
 *   - an undeclared process is reported as unattributed and does not satisfy a named agent.
 *
 * Linux only, because attribution reads /proc/net/tcp and the whole identity story rests on it.
