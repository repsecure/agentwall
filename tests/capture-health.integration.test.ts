/**
 * `agentwall doctor` reporting capture, measured against a real server and real egress.
 *
 * The point of this file is that nothing in it is a fixture. A real `src/index.ts` process
 * writes the chain, real child processes with real comms make real proxied requests, and the
 * real `dist/cli.js doctor` reads what the server wrote. That matters more here than usual:
 * doctor's whole job is to notice traffic nobody declared, and a doctor tested only against
 * chains its own test file wrote would keep agreeing with itself right up until src/index.ts
 * renamed a metadata key, at which point the section would go quietly green over an escaping
 * agent. Three controls in this repo have already shipped green and non-functional. This is
 * the measurement that keeps this one from being the fourth.
 *
 * Test order is load-bearing. Doctor advances a bookmark on every run, and "undeclared egress
 * since the last run" only means anything across successive runs, so these cases are written
 * as a sequence: baseline, escape, quiet, and each states which run it is.
 *
 * Linux-only, because /proc attribution is.
