/**
 * Two agents, one host, different policies, measured against the real thing.

 * This suite deliberately does NOT import AgentWall. It writes a config file, starts
 * `src/index.ts` as its own process exactly the way an operator does, drives real HTTP
 * through the real forward proxy from real child processes, and then reads the audit chain
 * file the server wrote. Every layer that a per-agent claim depends on is exercised:
 *
 *   - the config loader parses the fleet section and the registry rejects an ambiguous one
 *   - /proc/net/tcp maps a client socket to a pid, a comm, and a uid
 *   - the registry binds that to a declared agent
 *   - that agent's own allowlist decides the connection
 *   - the budget refuses the connection after the ceiling
 *   - the chain records which agent it was and what the counter said
 *
 * A test that asserted against a rendered verdict string would prove none of that. The
 * standard here is the same one the perimeter learned the hard way when nft rejected a chain
 * name that every unit test had happily accepted: only the real component's answer counts.
 *
 * Linux-only, because /proc attribution is. It is skipped elsewhere rather than silently
 * asserting less.
