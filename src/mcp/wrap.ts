 * A stdio wrap owns a child process and is finished when that child exits, which is why it resolves

 * exit code to report. What the two do share - the gates, the audit metadata, the session state -
 * is shared for real, through createFrameHandling, which is the part that had to be identical.
 *
 * There is no command to hash here. `commandHash` exists to pin a binary this host launched, and
 * nothing about a remote server is pinned by anything on this side of the connection: the operator
 * is trusting a URL and whatever authenticates it. The record says so by carrying `mcpUpstream`
