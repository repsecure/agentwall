/**
 * The stdio interception point.
 *
 * AgentWall runs the MCP server as its own child and holds both ends of the
 * pipe: the client's stdin arrives here first, the server's stdout leaves here
 * last. Nothing crosses in either direction without passing an interceptor, so
 * "protected" can mean every frame rather than every frame we happened to notice.
 *
 * The wrapper owns no policy on purpose. It parses, hands each frame to a
 * callback, and does what the returned FrameAction says. Where that decision
 * came from — gates, engine, hash chain — is not this file's business, which is
 * what keeps the transport testable without a policy engine and the policy
 * testable without a subprocess.
 *
 * Failure posture is closed. A line that will not parse is not forwarded, and an
 * interceptor that throws blocks rather than passes: a scanner crashing is the
 * moment you least want an unscanned frame going through.
 *
 * Scope limit worth stating plainly: this protects the stdio conversation, not
 * the server process. A wrapped server can still open its own sockets, read its
 * own files and spawn its own children, none of which travels over the pipe we
 * hold. The egress and tool planes are what cover that ground; wrapping stdio
 * buys visibility into the protocol, not a sandbox.
