/**
 * Newline-delimited JSON-RPC framing for the MCP stdio transport.
 *
 * Why a hand-written parser: this sits in the path of every frame the agent
 * exchanges with a wrapped server, so whatever parses it is part of the trust
 * story. The entire job is "find 0x0A, decode the bytes before it", which does
 * not justify importing code we do not control into the security path.
 *
 * Two properties matter more than throughput:
 *
 * 1. Chunk boundaries are arbitrary. A pipe read can end mid-frame, mid-line or
 *    mid-codepoint, so bytes accumulate as a Buffer and only complete lines are
 *    decoded. Decoding each chunk as it arrives would replace any UTF-8 sequence
 *    straddling the boundary with U+FFFD, quietly mutating tool arguments before
 *    a scanner ever sees them.
 * 2. Anything that does not parse is reported, never guessed at. A caller that
 *    cannot read a frame cannot police it, so malformed lines come back on their
 *    own channel and the transport fails closed on them.
 *
 * This layer answers "is this a JSON-RPC 2.0 envelope"; it does not answer "is
 * this a coherent MCP message". That second question belongs to the gates, and
 * splitting it here would put protocol judgement in two places that then have to
 * be kept in agreement.

 * UTF-8 newline.

 * line containing no newline at all, and the buffer grows until the wrapper is
 * OOM-killed. Killing the wrapper is precisely how you get an agent talking to
 * an unwrapped server, so an unbounded buffer here is a denial-of-service
 * primitive aimed at the security component itself. 8 MiB is generous for real
 * traffic — tool results carrying file contents or base64 images sit well under
 * it — and the overflow path drops the pending line and resynchronises on the
 * next newline rather than trying to salvage a frame it never fully saw.
