# Agentwall container image.
#
# What this image is for, stated before anything else, because the honest answer is
# narrower than "run Agentwall":
#
#   - The control plane. Policy evaluation, DLP, approvals, the dashboard, the runtime
#     guards, and the tamper-evident audit chain all work exactly as they do on a host,
#     because none of them read another process's /proc.
#   - Egress attribution for processes that share the container's PID and network
#     namespaces, which is the sidecar case: `--network=container:agent
#     --pid=container:agent`, with the agent running as the same uid and gid, attributes
#     that agent fully and needs no host namespace and no AppArmor change.
#   - Trying Agentwall without installing Node.
#
# What it is NOT for by default: attributing egress to processes on the HOST. Attribution
# maps a client socket to its owner by reading /proc/net/tcp, which is per network
# namespace, and then /proc/<pid>/fd, which is per PID namespace and gated by
# PTRACE_MODE_READ. A container has its own of both namespaces, so a host agent's
# connection resolves to no process and the record carries pid null, comm unknown. That is
# a real reduction of the product's headline capability, not a rough edge. It is recorded
# honestly rather than hidden: the ledger says null, the audit event's agentId says
# "unattributed", and docs/install.md gives the measured flag matrix, including the two
# combinations that restore host attribution and the privilege each one costs.

# Base pinned by digest, not by tag. `node:22-slim` is a moving target: the same tag
# resolves to different bytes week to week, so a tag-pinned build is not reproducible and
# a rebuild can quietly change the runtime under a signed release. The trailing comment
# names the tag the digest belonged to when it was resolved; Dependabot's docker ecosystem
# opens the bump PRs against this line.

# COPY preserves the mode of the build context, so these three paths arrive carrying the
# umask of whoever ran `docker build`. On a machine with umask 077 that is 0600, and the
# image then only works for uid 1000: `--user 1001` cannot read the policy file and the
# process exits at startup. Attribution needs `--user`, so this would break the one flag
# combination the image exists to support. Normalizing here also makes the image
# independent of the builder's umask, which a release artifact has to be.
# a=rX is read for everyone, traverse on directories, write for nobody.

# The one writable path: approvals, approved manifest hashes, and (when
# AGENTWALL_AUDIT_FILE points here) the audit chain.
#
# Group 0 and group-writable, because `docker run --user <uid>` with no group assigns
# gid 0, and that is the common form. It does not cover every case: attributing a host
# process requires matching its gid as well as its uid, so that run passes
# `--user <uid>:<gid>` and lands outside both owner and group here. Such a run bind-mounts
# a host directory it owns over this path, which is what it should be doing anyway for an
# audit chain that has to outlive the container.
#
# No VOLUME instruction. It would create an anonymous volume on every `docker run`,
# initialized with uid 1000 ownership, which a run using `--user 1001:1001` cannot write
# to: a declared convenience that breaks the documented flags, plus a new orphan volume
# per container start.
RUN install -d -o node -g 0 -m 0775 /app/state

# Non-root. uid 1000 comes from the base image. It is deliberately NOT the uid of any host
# agent, and that mismatch alone is enough to make host-process attribution return null:
# reading /proc/<pid>/fd requires matching the target's uid and gid, or CAP_SYS_PTRACE.
# See docs/install.md, "Attribution inside a container", for the measured matrix.
